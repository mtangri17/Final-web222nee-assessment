                <h1><b>History and Themes along with How to Play The Game - "Temple Run" </b></h1>
                <h2><b>A brief History of Temple Run:</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Temple Run was designed, programmed, and produced by husband-and-wife team Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova with art by Kiril Tchangov.
                    The game took a total of four months to develop.
                    Development began after the financial failure of Imangi Studio's previous game, Max Adventure and used that game to prototype Temple Run's controls. 
                    Imangi Studios wanted to make a quick game with simpler controls in contrast to Max Adventure's dual analog controls.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the temple design was solidified, Imangi Studios questioned the player character's motivation for constantly running without any breaks and came up with the idea of having something chasing him. Imangi Studios originally had the aliens from Max Adventure as placeholders.
                    Kiril created the design of evil demon monkeys and gave them skull masks due to his desire of adding skulls in games he's involved in.
                    Natalia initially did not like having evil demon monkeys chasing the player character and found them terrifying. 
                    Keith and Kiril, however, liked the evil demon monkeys and convinced Natalia to remain in the final product. 
                    Natalia later admitted that they were right and that it added immediacy and adrenaline.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The game was released on the App Store on August 4, 2011. The game was originally for 99 cents to download, but was switched to freemium prior to December 2011.After the release of its sequel Temple Run 2, the game renamed to Temple Run: Classic.
                    
                    On January 12, 2012, Imangi Studios announced on the Temple Run Facebook page that the game would be released for the Android platform in February.
                    The game was released on Google Play on March 27, 2012, a month later than expected.
                    As Temple Run was originally released with a custom, flexible engine on iOS, there were some difficulties when it was ported to Android, primarily related to the use of the Unity game engine. The game frequently crashed, occasionally caused devices to overheat, and drained battery life extremely quickly.
                    
                    This led to generally unfavourable reviews.On March 27, 2013, the game was released for Windows Phone 8.
